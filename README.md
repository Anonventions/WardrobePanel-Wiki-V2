# 🎨 WardrobePanel — Full Character Creator for Minecraft

**WardrobePanel** is a premium Minecraft plugin that lets players customise their skin through a web-based character editor. Players mix and match base skins, hairstyles, eye colours, clothing, accessories, and more — all rendered live in a 3D viewer, then applied to their in-game skin automatically.

## 📦 Requirements

| Requirement | Version |
|---|---|
| Minecraft Server | **Paper/Purpur 1.21+** |
| Java | **21+** |
| MineSkin API Key | Free at [mineskin.org/apikey](https://mineskin.org/apikey) |
| SkinsRestorer | **Recommended** (for skin application) |
| PlaceholderAPI | **Optional** (for placeholders) |

---

## 🚀 Quick Setup

### Step 1: Install the Plugin
1. Drop `WardrobePanel-V1.3.1.jar` into your server's `plugins/` folder
2. Start your server once — the plugin will generate its config files and `web/` folder
3. Stop the server

### Step 2: Configure `config.yml`
Open `plugins/WardrobePanel/config.yml` and set these critical values:

```yaml
web:
  host: "0.0.0.0"           # ← ALWAYS leave this as 0.0.0.0
  port: 50424                # ← Pick an open port
  public-url: "http://YOUR_SERVER_IP:50424"  # ← Your real IP goes here!
  theme: "default"           # ← Any of the 12 themes
  layout: "classic"          # ← Any of the 6 layouts

mineskin:
  api-key: "YOUR_MINESKIN_API_KEY"  # ← Get from mineskin.org/apikey
```

> ⚠️ **Critical:** `host` must be `0.0.0.0`. Your public IP goes in `public-url` only!

### Step 3: Install the Setup Files
1. Unzip **`setup.zip`** — this contains the `overlays/` and `skins/` folders, this should go directly into the plugin folder.
2. Copy the extracted `web/` folder contents into `plugins/WardrobePanel/web/` (merge with existing)

### Step 4: Install the Assets
1. Unzip **`assets.zip`** — this contains icons, backgrounds, cursors, fonts, this goes into web folder inside the plugin folder.
2. Copy the `assets/` folder into `plugins/WardrobePanel/web/` (merge with existing `assets/`)

### Step 5: Choose Your Layout
1. Unzip **`layouts.zip`** to see all 6 layout options
2. Copy `index.html` and `style.css` from your chosen layout folder into `plugins/WardrobePanel/web/`
3. Or simply set `web.layout: "theater"` (or any layout name) in `config.yml`

### Step 6: Open the Port
Make sure the port you chose (e.g. `50424`) is open in your hosting firewall.

### Step 7: Start & Test
1. Start the server
2. Run `/webchar editor` in-game — you'll receive a clickable link
3. Open the link in your browser — the character editor should load

## 👕 Adding / Changing Overlays & Skins

### Folder Structure

```
web/assets/
├── overlays/
│   ├── accessories/     ← Accessory overlays
│   ├── beards/          ← Beard overlays
│   ├── eyes/            ← Eye overlays
│   ├── hairs/           ← Hair overlays
│   ├── jackets/         ← Jacket overlays
│   ├── markings/        ← Marking overlays
│   ├── pants/           ← Pants overlays
│   ├── shirts/          ← Shirt overlays
│   ├── shoes/           ← Shoe overlays
│   └── skin-colours/    ← Base skin PNG files
├── skins/               ← Base skin files (used for preview rendering)
├── manifest.json        ← Auto-generated index of all overlays
└── catalog.json         ← Category definitions, palettes, colours
```

### Adding New Overlays

1. Create your overlay as a **64×64 PNG** (standard Minecraft skin format)
2. Only draw on the 2nd layer (overlay layer) of the skin template
3. Drop the PNG file into the appropriate category folder (e.g. `overlays/hairs/`)
4. Run `/webchar reload` in-game — the manifest is regenerated automatically
5. The new overlay will appear in the editor immediately

### Changing Base Skins

1. Replace or add PNGs in `overlays/skin-colours/`
2. Keep the naming convention: `base-steve-male.png`, `base-alex-female.png`, etc.
3. Run `/webchar reload`

> ⚠️ **Important:** When the plugin reloads or starts, it auto-scans all overlay folders and regenerates `manifest.json`. You never need to edit manifest.json manually.

---

## 👤 Profiles & Saved Outfits

### Profiles

Each player can have multiple character profiles (like RPG character slots):

- **Create:** `/webchar create MyWarrior`
- **List:** `/webchar list`
- **Edit:** `/webchar editor MyWarrior` — opens the web editor for that profile
- **Load/Apply:** `/webchar load MyWarrior` — applies that profile's skin in-game
- **Rename:** `/webchar rename MyWarrior MyKnight`
- **Copy:** `/webchar copy MyWarrior MyBackup`
- **Delete:** `/webchar delete MyWarrior`

### Saved Outfits

Within each profile, players can save multiple named outfits in the web editor:

1. Customise your character in the editor
2. Click the **+** button in the sidebar
3. Enter a name for the outfit
4. The outfit appears in the sidebar — click to load it anytime
5. Hover and click **✕** to delete

---

## 🛒 Owned Items System

Enable a shop-like system where players must "own" items before they can use them:

```yaml
owned-items:
  enabled: true
  starter-categories:
    - "eyes"               # Everyone gets all eyes for free
  starter-overlays: []     # Specific free overlays: ["hairs/short_hair"]
  combine-with-permissions: true
```

### Admin Commands

```
/webchar give <player> all                    — Give all items
/webchar give <player> category <name>        — Give all items in a category
/webchar give <player> overlay <category/id>  — Give a specific overlay

/webchar revoke <player> all                  — Revoke all items
/webchar revoke <player> category <name>      — Revoke items in a category
/webchar revoke <player> overlay <category/id>— Revoke a specific overlay
```

---

## 🔐 Permission-Based Filtering

Control which items players can see in the editor:

```yaml
permissions:
  enabled: true
  default-allowed: true    # true = see everything unless denied
  bypass-permission: "wardrobepanel.bypass"
```

### Permission Nodes

| Pattern | Example | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `wardrobepanel.skin.<id>` | `wardrobepanel.skin.base-steve-male` | Access to a specific base skin |
| `wardrobepanel.overlay.<cat>.<id>` | `wardrobepanel.overlay.hairs.male-90s_Side_Part` | Access to a specific overlay |
| `wardrobepanel.overlay.<cat>.*` | `wardrobepanel.overlay.hairs.*` | Access to all overlays in a category |
| `wardrobepanel.overlay.*` | — | Access to all overlays |
| `wardrobepanel.bypass` | — | See all items (bypass filtering) |

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED" / Site can't be reached

1. ✅ Make sure `host` is `"0.0.0.0"` in config.yml — NOT your IP
2. ✅ Make sure the port is open in your hosting firewall
3. ✅ Make sure `public-url` has `http://` prefix
4. ✅ Check the console — look for `Web server started on 0.0.0.0:PORT`

### "BindException: Cannot assign requested address"

You put your server IP in the `host` field. Change it to `"0.0.0.0"`.

### Skin not applying in-game

1. ✅ Check your MineSkin API key is valid
2. ✅ Make sure SkinsRestorer is installed
3. ✅ Try `/webchar load <profile>` manually
4. ✅ Check console for MineSkin API errors

### Web editor loads but shows "Session invalid"

1. ✅ Make sure `public-url` matches the URL you're visiting
2. ✅ Use a fresh link from `/webchar editor`
3. ✅ Sessions expire after the configured time (default: 24h)

### Overlays not showing after adding new files

1. ✅ Run `/webchar reload` to regenerate the manifest
2. ✅ Make sure overlays are 64×64 PNG files
3. ✅ Check the overlay is in the correct category folder
